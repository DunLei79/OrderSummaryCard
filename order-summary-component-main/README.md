## Overview
First of many I hope... 

### Built with

- HTML5 
- CSS 
- Flexbox

### What I learned

This was my first project I did (with no youtube tutorial) from start to finish. I started coding a month and a half ago, and this was helpful. Not only with coding but to setup Github account and having to learn git.   

This helped me to wrap my head around the flexbox concept. Code is still sloppy, but I didnâ€™t want to copy and paste anything.  

### Useful resources

- [Resource](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCSJbGtTlrDami-tDGPUV9-w) - Very good flexbox vids.
